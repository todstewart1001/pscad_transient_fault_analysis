In this basic simulation of a fault in PSCAD, a three phase voltage source is set up, a breaker and a fault are implemented, and data is captured via ammeters and voltmeters. Graphs of instantaneous currents and voltages at each phase are captured.

The unbalanced fault includes phase A and B, but not C. This can be seen in the corresponding graphs. The fault occurs at .2 seconds. Voltage and current for phase C remain unchanged, but at phases A and B, current fluctuations increase and voltage drops to 0.
